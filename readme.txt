COMP90043 Project A part 2
Kunliang Wu / 684226
=============================
I only finished the basic part in this project(no bonus part included).

Also, I have exported a runnable jar ,stream_cipher.jar.

Just simply run 
java -jar stream_cipher.jar with legitimate arguments.
e.g:
-ip dimefox.eng.unimelb.edu.au -port 8001 -studentId 684226

And it will give you some output.

If you can get readable message in the end, that means you have successfully 
communicated with the server via stream cipher.
